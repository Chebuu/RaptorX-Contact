# RaptorX-Contact: a software package for protein contact and distance prediction by deep residual neural network. 
This package has source code of the deep learning method developed by Xu group for protein contact/distance prediction and distance-based folding. The code and documentation will be improved gradually. Anaconda, Theano and possibly BioPython shall be installed in order to use this package.

The package contains core code used to produce results in the following papers. 
1) Analysis of distance-based protein structure prediction by deep learning in CASP13. PROTEINS, 2019
2) Distance-based protein folding powered by deep learning. PNAS, August 2019
3) ComplexContact: a web server for inter-protein contact prediction using deep learning. NAR, May 2018
4) Analysis of deep learning methods for blind protein contact prediction in CASP12. PROTEINS, March 2018
5) Folding Membrane Proteins by Deep Transfer Learning. Cell Systems, September 2017
6) Accurate De Novo Prediction of Protein Contact Map by Ultra-Deep Learning Model. PLoS CB, Jan 2017

Some auxiliary code will be gradually uploaded.
